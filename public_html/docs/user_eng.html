                There are two posibilities, how to load HILLS files from Plumed into this tool.<br>
                You can choose files by File picker accesible by "Choose files" button. 
                More than one file can be picked with usage of Ctrl or Shift key.
                Another possibility is to drag and drop chosed files into the empty center of the program area.
            </p>
            <p>
                The program accepts HILLS files produced by Plumed 1.3 or Plumed 2. Syntax of files are recognised automatically, nothing has to be manually adjusted.
                Gaussians written in HILLS files are being sorted according time (in the case of Plumed 1.3 files) or timestamp (Plumed 2.x). 
                For disabling sorting, "sort=false" has to be written into the address line (see further).
