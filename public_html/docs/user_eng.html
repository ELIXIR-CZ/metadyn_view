                    <p class="p3">
                        For educational purposes several example HILLS files are included in the program. Any of them can be picked by clicking on "Examples" button and selecting an example. More information
                        about the simulations are in the accompanied article.</p>
                <p class="p2">
                    The program accepts HILLS files produced by Plumed 1.3 or Plumed 2. Syntax of files are recognised automatically, nothing has to be manually adjusted.
                    Gaussians written in HILLS files are being sorted according time (in the case of Plumed 1.3 files) or timestamp (Plumed 2.x). 
                    For disabling sorting, "sort=false" has to be written into the address line (see further).

                    <p class="p3 li">tst=2 - runs prepared benchmarks for evaluation of the program. Benchmarks was prepared in such way that all produces 100 points on author's PC. Values less than 20 points could mean that visualization performace is severy hindered.</p>
